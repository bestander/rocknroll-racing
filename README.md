# Rock'N'Roll racing for web

This package contains:
- Sega Genesys libretro JS/wasm emulator
- index.html that starts the game
- Rock'N'Roll racing ROM game (removed from repo due to, you know)

This is a proof of concept, I'd like to see if I can use WebRTC to play one of my favorite games over network.

# Thanks

- To Leonardo Russo for [Emulatrix](https://emulatrix.lrusso.com.ar/) that showed a good isolated genesis/wasm integration.
- [Libretro](https://github.com/libretro) version of genesis wasm build
